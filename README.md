# Awesome 2048 (previously known as 2048 and beyond)
> Play and waste your time! :-)

Waste and lose at least 8 hours of your life... then **multiply** it... ;-)

[Gabriele Cirulli](https://twitter.com/gabrielecirulli) started a revolution with his dead simple game: 2048. The code is released under the MIT license, and you are free to **hack it**. But if all the hours you spent playing the game were not enought, here is something for you.
